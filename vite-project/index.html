        So you're looking at all of these crates. You say, 'Saxton, why do you
        have these crates lying around' Great question! Turns out someone snuck
        into the back crate supply and was siphoning these out. How? Well don't
        worry about that for now. The problem is, we can't sell these as "new"
        crates anymore. They're technically used. At least that's what
        department head tells me. Blah blah blah, this that, now we have a
        temporary refurbished crate store! We couldn't just throw these out
        because it would be a "loss of profit", so we set this up as a way to
        make back the money we would have lost by throwing away the crates
        someone's grubby fingers have touched. Have a look around! Buy
        something!
